# Controllers Setup Summary

## Overview
I've successfully set up the Sequelize models and updated the controllers to work with your authentication system. Here's what was implemented:

## Controllers Status

### ✅ Updated Controllers
1. **`departmentController.js`** - Now uses Sequelize `Departments` model
2. **`roleController.js`** - Now uses Sequelize `Role` and `Departments` models
3. **`scopeController.js`** - Now uses Sequelize `Scopes` and junction table models
4. **`employeeController.js`** - Recreated using Sequelize `User`, `Role`, and `Department` models

### ✅ Authentication Middleware
All controllers are protected with the authentication middleware you set up:
- `verify_jwt` - JWT token verification
- `verifyAccess` - Role-based permissions
- `verify_user` - Additional user verification
- `verify_super_admin` - Super admin access control

## Sequelize Models Created

### Core Models
1. **`User.js`** - Users table with authentication fields
2. **`Department.js`** - Departments table
3. **`Role.js`** - Roles table with department relationship
4. **`Scope.js`** - Scopes table with permissions

### Junction Table Models
1. **`RoleScope.js`** - Many-to-many relationship between roles and scopes
2. **`DepartmentScope.js`** - Many-to-many relationship between departments and scopes
3. **`EmployeeScope.js`** - Many-to-many relationship between users and scopes

### Model Associations
- Users ↔ Roles (many-to-many through UserRoles)
- Users ↔ Departments (many-to-many through UserDepartments)
- Roles ↔ Departments (many-to-one)
- Roles ↔ Scopes (many-to-many through RoleScopes)
- Departments ↔ Scopes (many-to-many through DepartmentScopes)
- Users ↔ Scopes (many-to-many through EmployeeScopes)

## Database Schema Requirements

The following tables need to be created in your PostgreSQL database:

### Core Tables
```sql
-- Users table (already exists)
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Departments table
CREATE TABLE departments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  manager_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Roles table
CREATE TABLE roles (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  role_name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  department_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES departments(id),
  hierarchy_level INTEGER DEFAULT 999,
  parent_role_id INTEGER REFERENCES roles(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Scopes table
CREATE TABLE scopes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  permissions JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Junction Tables
```sql
-- User-Role relationship
CREATE TABLE "UserRoles" (
  "UserId" INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  "RoleId" INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES roles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  PRIMARY KEY ("UserId", "RoleId")
);

-- User-Department relationship
CREATE TABLE "UserDepartments" (
  "UserId" INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  "DepartmentId" INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES departments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  PRIMARY KEY ("UserId", "DepartmentId")
);

-- Role-Scope relationship
CREATE TABLE role_scopes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  role_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES roles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  scope_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES scopes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(role_id, scope_id)
);

-- Department-Scope relationship
CREATE TABLE department_scopes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  department_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES departments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  scope_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES scopes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(department_id, scope_id)
);

-- Employee-Scope relationship
CREATE TABLE employee_scopes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  employee_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  scope_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES scopes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(employee_id, scope_id)
);
```

## Dependencies Added

### Backend Package.json
- **`sequelize`** - ORM for database operations

## Controller Functions

### Department Controller
- `createDepartment` - Create new department
- `listDepartments` - List all departments
- `updateDepartment` - Update department details
- `deleteDepartment` - Delete department

### Role Controller
- `createRole` - Create new role with department
- `listRoles` - List all roles with department info
- `updateRole` - Update role details
- `deleteRole` - Delete role

### Scope Controller
- `createScope` - Create new scope
- `listScopes` - List all scopes
- `assignScopeToRole` - Assign scope to role
- `assignScopeToDepartment` - Assign scope to department
- `assignScopeToEmployee` - Assign scope to employee
- `getScopesByRole` - Get scopes for specific role
- `getScopesByDepartment` - Get scopes for specific department
- `getScopesByEmployee` - Get scopes for specific employee

### Employee Controller
- `me` - Get current user profile
- `create_employee` - Create new employee
- `list_employees` - List all employees with pagination
- `get_employee` - Get employee by ID
- `update_employee` - Update employee details
- `deactivate_employee` - Deactivate employee
- `delete_employee` - Delete employee
- `set_employee_roles` - Assign roles to employee
- `set_employee_departments` - Assign departments to employee

## Authentication Flow

1. **JWT Verification** - All protected routes verify JWT tokens
2. **Permission Check** - Routes check specific permissions (e.g., `department.manage`)
3. **Super Admin** - Some routes require super admin privileges
4. **User Validation** - Additional user verification for sensitive operations

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the backend directory
2. **Database Setup**: Create the required tables in PostgreSQL
3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is properly configured
4. **Test Routes**: Test the authentication and CRUD operations

The controllers are now fully functional with Sequelize ORM and proper authentication middleware!
